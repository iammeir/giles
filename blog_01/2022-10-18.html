<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>I saw my brother had been making focaccia, and I’ve started doing that as well. Bread is a gratifying food to make by hand. I tried to accomodate all the veges we got in our Locavore order but looked in the fridge today and saw the cucumber and asparagus looking lonely and abandoned. I’d completely forgot to make plans for them. It’s hard to remember to use the veges I’m not keen on. The cucumber will probably make a salad. THe asparagus I have no idea.</p>
<h2 id="bookmaking">Bookmaking</h2>
<p>Is on hold, I need to work up the enthusiasm to make another stamp. I have plenty else to do though so I don’t mind that this is stalled. Bookmaking is very much a foul weather activity, so I may not get back to the project until autumn when the nights close in.</p>
<h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2>
<p>I know the principle of rereading books, and I’d like to do it more. Re-listening to podcasts might be even more rewarding - I feel I retain very little concrete detail from any one listen. I have in mind voice of the iceberg, containers, the left right game, and certain episodes of make it then tell everybody.</p>
