<p><em>alas</em></p>
<h2 id="garden">Garden</h2>
<p>Ivy in the compost. I think the next ten years will be an ongoing battle with ivy. Of course a problem once considered is often solved. a <a href="https://www.homesandgardens.com/gardens/how-to-get-rid-of-ivy">moment’s internet search</a> pulled up good methods for removing it. Maybe just the next five years will be a battle. Some cabbage has also bolted, which I didn’t know cabbage could do. I presume the leaves work just the same. Most of my garden time will be taken up mowing the lawn for the foreseeable future, alas.</p>
<h2 id="videogames">Videogames</h2>
<p>I caught up with my brother and he mentioned he had been playing <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/">Brogue</a> on my recommendation. This has reinvigorated my desire to play it. Within my enjoyment of the game is some aspiration to produce/experience something similar to <a href="https://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/Introduction/">Boatmurdered</a>, the incredible tale of a team of people passing a save file of Dwarf Fortress between them. I currently don’t live long enough to create that richness of story, alas.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I still have plenty to read but I am drawn to the library. I also have a $50 book voucher burning a hole in my pocket. I picked up 23 Arthur C Clarke books on ereader, and a book of isaac asimov short stories from a box down the road (along with some great enamel coated saucepans). I am not sure if I will persist with 100 years of solitude, alas.</p>
