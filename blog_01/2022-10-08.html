<p><em>Of course the literal mind is never that far away</em></p>
<h2 id="evening">Evening</h2>
<p>I biked down to pick up the milk, which was really nice. I wanted to spend the remaining part of the evening screen-free, reading a book, but unfortunately Fenn wasn’t going down smoothly when I returned, so I took over to let Erin sleep and this means I’m on the laptop. One must hold these things lightly.</p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.splendidtable.org/story/2019/04/10/early-spring-stew-with-baked-ricotta">spring stew</a> by Anna Jones has a fantastic ratio of ease of preparation:impressiveness of outcome. In classic internet fashion I played fast and loose with the recipe but it turned out excellent anyway. I also made a sauce for palak paneer in the slow cooker, as part of the effort to reduce weekday food prep work.</p>
<h2 id="board-games">Board Games</h2>
<p>A friend took Alistair out for the morning so Erin and I played <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/84876/castles-burgundy">Castles of Burgundy</a>. We originally received it as an (incredibly thoughtful) gift from a friend - it’s not the sort of box I would have picked off the shelf but it really lands the noodle-cooking and tactile joy of a bitsy euro game - that is, a game with little direct conflict, interlocking mechanisms and systems, and lots of bits. The sort of game we couldn’t bring out around a two year old. I couldn’t unite the interests of my princedom and Erin secured a strong and sustained lead.</p>
