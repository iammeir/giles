<h2 id="garden">Garden</h2>
<p>Took a broccoli head from the garden yesterday to use in dinner. As I began to cut it I noticed some of the buds falling off onto the board. Then I noticed some of those buds wriggling. In the past I’ve discovered caterpillars the same shade as the broccoli stalk. Now I have discovered bugs the same shape and colour as the broccoli bud. In time I will find every part of the broccoli anatomy imitated by insects.</p>
<p>Head full of garden dreams atm.</p>

<p>(game making has been put on the back burner for the next 6-9 months while gardening takes precedence.)</p>
<p>I have been browsing this <a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com">webring</a> recently. While I have found most of the blogs not to my taste, I was struck by a page of one author, who demured that they wanted to make games but usually only got as far as making mockups, and then had <a href="https://parkimminent.com/site/mockups.html">a gallery of said mockups</a>. I really enjoyed them, and the idea was a revelation to me. At this point in my life I play very little games (not much time spent playing games and games that are short/small), and the majority of my enjoyment of the medium comes from seeing gifs and screenshots and imagining what it would be like to play those games. I could do the same with game making - making a mockup of an idea could be more satisfying than trying to make a prototype.</p>

<p>I’m still copying poems out of my journal, wow there’s lots. It’s really encouraging to see the yield of a successful habit. I’ve been editing them too and now have a bevy ready for submission to journals or for collecting into another chapbook. I would like to make another chapbook.</p>
<p>I came across <a href="https://everest-pipkin.com/#projects/never.html">i’ve never picked a protected flower</a> by Everest Pipkin. It’s really good.</p>
