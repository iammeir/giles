<h2 id="yesterday">Yesterday</h2>
<p>Was also tiring, but with a more satisfying outcome to it. We mowed the lawns, cleared the weeds around some of the flax, planned the ‘dream’ for our property, and I bought a long anticipated book: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain%27s_Jawbone">Cain’s jawbone</a>, a cryptic murder mystery. I don’t buy it expecting to be able to solve it, but I’m going to try.</p>
<h2 id="alcohol">Alcohol</h2>
<p>Many months ago I bought a small bottle of absinthe. ~ 74%, and strongly tasting of aniseed. Occasionally I dampen the bottom of a very small glass. Last night was dedicated to reading and watching the weather develop, and occasioned a drink. the sky was desaturated and the drink was the opposite.</p>
<h2 id="capable">Capable</h2>
<p>I don’t consider myself to be capable. I do think I’m capable, but it’s something that I have to tell myself from the outside, or recognise in the praise of someone else. Today I solely focused on reading an inherited script and commenting it. It was really useful - and I feel my output will also be really useful.</p>
