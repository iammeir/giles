<p><em>Housefly, tapping my window like morse code at dawn.</em></p>
<h2 id="garden">Garden</h2>
<p>I fantasise about a life where I spend my whole day working on the property. week after week I attend to every detail, weeding everything, planting everything, planning, cleaning, building, a verdant garden to nourish us all. Instead I spend an hour a week, tops, and dig half a hole. I wish only to grow a zucchini this year. Everything else is a bonus. I try to squash the false belief that I will garden us through economic insecurity - not because it isn’t possible, though it isn’t, but because it’s looking to my own strength as provider.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>I see myself spreading out over different tasks, which suits my fleeting attention, but I perhaps should try some sustained work one day this week. I’ll be taking some time out on thursday to check out a potential new car - I’ll drive it to the mechanics and get a prepurchase inspection, and drive it past our house and rev it so Erin can hear and give her opinion.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>Still Lord of the Rings. I’ve come across some good shorter pieces online but they’ve been transient. Really enjoying, as always, the missives from <a href="https://craigmod.com/">Craig Mod</a>, who’s running <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/148/">another pop up newsletter</a></p>
