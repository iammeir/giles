<p>Two great pico-8 games: <a href="https://sabajt.itch.io/mushroom-mountain">Mushroom Mountain</a> and <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=45334">Birds With Guns</a>. Pico-8 games often have suffer from busy, crowded screens and confusing visual language, making it far too hard to parse in such a low resolution. These games manage to put a lot on the screen without compromising clarity.</p>

<p>My work desk is, I’ve firmly concluded, too small. Additionally, I don’t have anywhere to put work stuff that isn’t on the desk or in a pile. So I’ve found some Open license desk designs and reached out to a local CNC milling company for a quote for cutting a desk and storage units. Afterwards I will construct them myself. I’m hoping in this way to gain skills, an affinity with my furniture, and get a high end product for a mid end cost.</p>

<p>I left a note in my writing journal about prayer and everytime I’ve opened it this week I’ve seen the note and instead of writing spent time praying. I do not regret this at all - I want to cultivate a habit of prayer more than any other habit, and I have no doubt that putting prayer first I will find all I care about closer at hand.</p>
