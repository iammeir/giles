<p><em>Always Be Knolling</em></p>
<h2 id="poetry">Poetry</h2>
<p>I won a prize for a poem! It’s always exciting when that happens. It’s a reminder as well to pick back up the initiative that led me to enter the two recent competitions. I was transcribing and editing my poems for just this reason. I lost the time I was using to do that, so I must prioritise it in other times. I also have a specific idea I want to return to, a longer poem about the drift between the real self and the self as online advertising sees it. I would also really enjoy pushing myself to embody poetry as process and make some more concrete stuff. All of this is just hot air though as the compass needle of interest points to book making atm.</p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>I haven’t sat down and fixed the food situation but I noticed I was making meals that double well only towards the end of the week, giving us extra when we need it least. I’m able to freeze some of it, fortunately, but that’s something to address - making bulk meals earlier in the week, or in the weekend. Tonight we had stir-fried rice, grating and slicing in the food processor the veges that got hurt by freezing in the fridge - a daikon, savoy cabbage, cauliflower and pak-choy.</p>
<h2 id="notetaking">Notetaking</h2>
<p>I think I’ve established a clear need for a habit in the area of keeping track of work at work and at home. I need a regular time and system to track and assess what tasks I have on my plate and plan when I’m going to do them. The bullet journal beckons - several members of my family have already recommended it. But I am reluctant to put my faith in it as I know the success or failure is in my hands as the practitioner more than in any system I choose.</p>
<p>I found this cool song/music video: <a href="https://vimeo.com/750231066">Adios</a></p>
