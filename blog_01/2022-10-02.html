<p>Nadia Lim has a <a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/shows/nadias-comfort-kitchen/recipes/fruit-crumble">foolproof recipe for crumble topping</a> it’s just so nice and we find the recipe makes enough for two puddings so you can freeze half and bring it out in a week like a gift from a friend. Reheated the risotto and accidentally nearly made congee.</p>
<p>We decided to enter into a covenant with pak’n save’s click and collect function, and we’ve ordered a month’s worth of cupboard food. This will free us up to spend shopping time going to the local stores instead of pack’n save all the time.</p>

<p>Big work today, filled the woodbox by the door and cleared the stack by the house. did a little bit of weeding, Erin swept the path, I mowed the berm and planted six flax along under the concrete wall at the front of the property. Fully 70% of the work in my estimation was clean up after the tasks were done.</p>
