<p><em>But whose ship sunk on whose shore?</em></p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>I have now eaten that cauliflower twice and twice had a gut reaction. I finally googled IBS and I think I’ll book an appointment with the doctor. There was something else recently, I forget what, where I had for so long lived with the difficulty rather than take action, even though the remedy or action is obvious. It feels like I have cognitive blinders on sometimes.</p>
<h2 id="garden">Garden</h2>
<p>In a gesture of incredible generosity a friend came by today and in the rain planted two apple trees on our section. I am filled with gratitude, and excitement for the future as these trees grow and establish themselves. I don’t expect any fruit off them this year.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I’ve been reading The Lord Of The Rings. I’m about halfway through. Gimli is much more eloquent than in the films and I like this. I’ve found but not read <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/sjp.12477">an article</a> postulating that Tolkien designs a racial hierarchy in the novels that recapitulates the central racist myth of European thought. Even without reading the article it’s not hard to see what the author’s getting at.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>I’ve enquired for quotes to get a cnc machine to mill the parts for a new desk. Exciting times ahead.</p>
