<p>When I make leek and potato soup the first spoonful always has me thinking “aw man this is kind of insipid bummer” but by the end of the bowl I’m convinced it’s the most sophisticated and nuanced flavour. This happens every single time. Our fridge has for a long time been playing up, we thought we’d fixed it but we hadn’t, and now a bunch of veges are frozen. On the plus side Erin got a real high quality food processor with all the extras from the op shop recently, it’s transformed cooking with a newborn, so I have no qualms about running all those veges through the grating attachment and making an easy stir-fried rice. I’m still reluctant to lean into the boring simple dinners but I must accept that it’s necessary for this time.</p>

<p>In both the games I’m playing a lot of (doukutsu and mushroom mountain) I’m at a point where I have to commit a certain amount of time without a guarantee of saved progress afterwards. A certain amount of time I don’t have right now. And so I slide off to other games.</p>

<p>It’s getting harder again for us to wake at the night feeds. I think we need periodic refreshes of our routines to keep us doing it - swap the carrot for a parsnip, metaphorically speaking.</p>
