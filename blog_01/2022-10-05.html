<p>Roast vege salad tonight, the first one I think I’ve ever made. Incredible success, very very nice and easy to put together. In general we’re still struggling to get meals simple enough that it doesn’t feel like a stretch to make them. I think I need to sit down and have a serious think about what meals would actually work for that. The challenge is incorporating all the fresh veges - they undeniably increase the workload. Upon sitting down and thinking I am confident I will emerge with a solution.</p>

<p>Sun, then hail, rain and snow. Spectacular weather - we got outside briefly to enjoy it. Snow seems to come in the spring. I am glad the seedlings are covered.</p>

<p>The quote for the desk and storage was much more than I expected, and even the quote for the desk alone is about $700. I am considering this carefully - I recognise I will get a desk of the highest quality, far higher than otherwise available in my area for this price.</p>
<p>I barely blinked at spending $15 on a set of poker dice - but this was pocket money set aside for frivolities. Still.</p>
