<h2 id="videogames">Videogames</h2>
<p>A friend considered the highlight of his week to be starting a subscription to Microsoft GamePass. I guess I can sort of understand, but I don’t feel like I mean the same thing as he does when I say ‘computer games’. I try to see the connection he makes with his other friends through the games they play. I don’t want to hold onto a smug intellectual superiority because I play games Bennett Foddy talks about and fit on a floppy disk.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>It’s been too long since I last went to the library. Strictly I still have books to read, but I need the mind expansion I get from being in the library, from issuing more books than I’ll read.</p>
<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>
<p>I have been working singlemindedly on a task (more or less) for the last few days at work and it’s felt really good. I’ve been able to focus more comprehenisively on what needs doing. This may herald a shift in how I work.</p>
