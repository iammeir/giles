<p><em>The burnt-out ends of smoky days.</em></p>
<h2 id="days">Days</h2>
<p>Are tiring. I had arranged to pick up a fridge today, and while I’m glad I did I realise it completely disrupted what was supposed to be a rest day. We felt the impact all day and through to now, where I’m just feeling more tired than ever. On the plus side the fridge is in good condition and much bigger than our current dysfunctional one.</p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>Made a foccacia for lunch today. Sublime, why didn’t I do this sooner. Wedges and eggs for dinner, simple. Our vege box arrived today, a lot of salad goods, and asparagus. I’m not so hot on asparagus but maybe this week I will learn to enjoy it. Each week after it arrives I must sort out how to use each vege in the coming week. I did this last week but we still ended up grating most of it into stir fried rice.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>I have done little to no writing lately. I’ve just been too tired and busy. I try to have grace for myself at this point. The writing will happen, this time is a dry valley and must be traversed without reproach.</p>
