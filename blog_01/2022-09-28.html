<p>Everything has come away, and ivy is springing up in unexpected places. I want to figure out a system for constant incremental weeding. The cauliflowers are at last showing small heads. Parsley and spinach is bolting, I will let it self sow. Many things growing in the potato patch - none of them potatoes. I mentioned to Erin that a certain large bucket of noxious weeds pulled from the garden needed emptying of water, or that I hadn’t gotten around to it. I was inside most of today recovering from a sinus infection. Erin emptied it for me and discovered the joys of anaerobic decomposition.</p>

<p>Going out shopping today I reflected that it takes a long time to get from store to store. I’m frustrated that we’ve made these mega stores and gutted the smaller local shops and now I have to spend 45 minutes of an hour driving around. On the big plus side I bought from the local fruit and vege shop (joe’s grocer) a cauliflower bigger than my head for $3. Shop local.</p>
