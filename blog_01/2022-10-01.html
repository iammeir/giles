<p><em>Sometimes the book is the content</em></p>
<h2 id="night">Night</h2>
<p>After a day of poor sleep Fenn slept four hours first leg of the night, so we slept 2-3. Erin and I are finding it physically difficult to stay awake. I downloaded <a href="https://archive.org/details/OneHundredYearsOfSolitude_201710">100 years of solitude</a> to read. Tonight returns the sore stomach that plagues me sometimes when I am awake at night.</p>

<p>The controller keybindings are a little strange on the pico-8 I want to change this.</p>

<p>I’ve deliberately kept quiet about this but I’ve been experimenting with stamps and notebooks. The idea is to make a stamp that I can easily use to break up the visual pattern of good-on-one-side papers’ used side. Hampered by local material shortages (our stamp pad dried up) but finally got a new one. Did some tests tonight and found that while cool the current stamp set up might be a little too complex to use at scale. I have a project on the horizon, making a lot of books at once, maybe 20 or more, and while accepting the manual process I have I want to streamline where I can.</p>
