<p><em>‘Bought some mini eggs, Mum. Bad luck.’</em></p>
<h2 id="poetry">Poetry</h2>
<p>I copied some more poems from my journal onto the computer last night, while we listened to the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c59b79b0cf57db0a3d8d54f/t/633d446eaad08f093d8d1116/1664959599266/Off+Menu+-+Ep165+-+Richard+Ayoade.pdf">Off-Menu episode with Richard Ayoade</a>. I like the results of rewriting a line distorted, as if it was misheard from another room. New meaning can emerge. It’s a bit like a DIY neural network. Haha it’s actually the OG neural network.</p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>For a long time I harboured a small annoyance at people keeping an online recipe database on their site, or in their blog. It felt a bit like people who will recite an entire recipe they made with ten minute monologue where every sentence starts with ‘just’. Recently I have changed - I recognised the otherness in myself and myself in everyone else. I love food. I get a lot of joy out of making it and enjoying it. I am proud of what I make. If I posted recipes online, I would not care who would read them. It’s a sign of pride, more than that, of affection. I’m still not going to do it myself, for the most part, but I appreciate why people do now, and in <a href="https://beachsports.neocities.org/2022-10-10/">certain circumstances</a> I really enjoy it. A recipe as a poem.</p>
<h2 id="sore">Sore</h2>
<p>I’ve had a sore stomach for a dew days, and last night I tweaked a muscle in my back. It was a sore night, and sleep was fitful. The wind blew - at midnight I went outside to make sure there was nothing to blow away. Everything washed out in moonlight. Bolting spinach menacing in the garden.</p>
