<p>I couldn’t understand why I was so irritable the past few days, after having two nights of heavily disrupted sleep. My nose is so close to my face I ignore it.</p>
<p>It turns out I’ve never had a nice asparagus. The archetype of the ideal snowpea, bursting in your mouth. It was so crisp, so tender. I was just born yesterday when I ate that asparagus.</p>

<p>Planted four zucchini seedlings, two cauliflower seedlings and a kamokamo seedling. took out the broccoli and flowering cabbage - I won’t buy that variety of cabbage again it wasn’t to our taste. Hope against hope, some of the older cauliflower are actually growing heads, modest but present. We will be away next week and I’m not sure how the remaining seedlings will fare without watering. I’ll give away what I can to the men’s group.</p>
