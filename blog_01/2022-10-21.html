<p>I went to the library, picked up pulp sci fi from the stack, more Annie Dillard and Journal Of A Solitude by May Sarton. I will return and hyperlink those at some point in the future. It did feel really good to go to the library and walk among the books. The librarian complimented me on my wallet, I sort of wish I had more to say than ‘aw kia ora, yeah I like it.’ Maybe I should prepare an artist statement I can use next time.</p>

<p>On the way home I stopped and bought gelato. It was every bit as good as I wanted it to be. My memory deceives but I think this didn’t use to happen as often for me: I’d anticipate an activity or event, carry it out and be disappointed, a little, as it didn’t meet my expectations. Now my expectations have changed, or my experiences have gotten better. Both are fine.</p>
<p>I really enjoy bread making.</p>

<p>We are going away for a week and I will not take the laptop, and won’t write here until we’re back.</p>
