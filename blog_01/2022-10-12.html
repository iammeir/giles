<h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2>
<p>I’ve been in a podcast winter for a short while, just sort of getting by on a few regular, comfort-food podcasts, but haven’t had anything that feels more substantial. Erin in contrast has just recently started to listen to podcasts regularly and has a few really good ones she’s getting a lot out of. I’ve taken up one that she dipped into, The <a href="https://thebiblefornormalpeople.com/podcast/">Bible For Normal People</a>. I’ve found it challenging my preconceptions and unconsciously held beliefs. I’m having to confront things I have no comfortable answer to.</p>
<h2 id="boardgames">Boardgames</h2>
<p>Alistair has just learned the core mechanism behind a <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63268/spot-it">Spot It</a> deck of cards, and is surprisingly good at matching symbols. I can’t wait to be able to play games with him.</p>
<h2 id="garden">Garden</h2>
<p>I got out tonight and finished digging the hole, buried <a href="https://compostcollective.org.nz/bokashi/">Bokashi</a> and raked in some garden feed on top. Tomorrow or the next day I’ll be moving a zucchini seedling.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>I keep confusing <a href="https://bigthief.bandcamp.com/">Big Thief</a> with <a href="https://jordanklassen.bandcamp.com/album/big-intruder">Big Intruder</a></p>
