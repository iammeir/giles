<p class= "future">I might be climbing again on <b>Sunday</b> the <b>20th June</b> from <b>2:30pm to 4pm</b>
<p class="present"></p>
<p class="past">I climbed on Friday the 18th June. I learned that no one climbs the same wall.
<p class="past">I did not climb on Wednesday the 9th June. The map is not the territory.
<p class="past">I climbed on Thursday the 3rd June. I learned to try other approaches.
<p class="past">I climbed on Wednesday the 2nd June. I learned to lay back.
<p class="past">I did <i>not</i> climb on Wednesday the 26th May. Two woods diverged on the path; plan and practice split like unfocused eyes.
<p class="past">I climbed on Sunday the 23rd May. I learned to plan it out.
<p class="past">I did <i>not</i> climb on Saturday the 22nd May. The future does not become the past. The narrator is unreliable.
<p class="past">I climbed on Wednesday the 19th May. I learned to hug the wall.

Some list poem I read in a class at uni that I've been unable to find now, where a guy records everything he sees from a cafe window over half an hour.</footer>
