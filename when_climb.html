<p class="present">I am climbing right now - to an acceptable approximation of "now" and "climbing"</p>
<p class="past">I climbed on Wednesday the 2nd June. I learned to lay back.
<p class-"past">I did <i>not</i> climb on Wednesday the 26th May. Two woods diverged on the path; plan and practice split like unfocused eyes.
<p class="past">I climbed on Sunday the 23rd May. I learned to plan it out.</p>
<p class="past">I did <i>not</i> climb on Saturday the 22nd May. The future does not become the past. The narrator is unreliable.</p>
<p class="past">I climbed on Wednesday the 19th May. I learned to hug the wall.</p>
