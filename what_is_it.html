  <h1>I know what you mean</h1>
  <p>
    A game about definitions for 2 players. <br>
  </p>
  <p>~</p>
  <p class="instructions">
    Player 1 thinks of an object, say, a <em>spoon</em>.
  </p>
  <p class="dialogue">
    P1 - I'm thinking of a spoon <br>
    P2 - Cool, what's a spoon? <br>
  </p>
  <p class="instructions">
    Player 1 then gives a single-detail description of a spoon. <br>
  </p>
  <p class="dialogue">
    P1 - It's a tool for eating
  </p>
  <p class="instructions">
    Player 2 willfully misinterprets this description
    for something else that matches that detail.
  </p>
  <p class="dialogue">
    <span title="A fork is, also, a tool for eating">
      P2 - Ahh you're thinking of a fork.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p class="instructions">
    Player 1 then has to clarify, by adding another detail. <br>
    The description must be positive - you cannot say what its not or doesn't have -  e.g. <br>
    <span style="color: tomato">"It doesn't have prongs" - wrong </span><br>
    <span style="color: green">"It can pick up liquids" - better <br>
  </p>
  <p class="dialogue">
    P1 - Well, It's not a fork because it's round. <br>
    <span title="Round, used for eating">
    P2 - Oh you mean a plate.</span><br>
    P1 - Not a plate, because it lifts the food to your mouth <br>
    <span title="Lifts food, round, used for eating">
    P2 - Oh of course, chopsticks. </span><br>
  </p>
  <p class="instructions">
    And so on and so forth, until Player 2 cannot think of any other option.<br>
    Then swap roles and start again!<br>
    The goal is to collaboratively extend the description as much as possible,
    always getting more specific, but still open to misinterpretation.<br>
