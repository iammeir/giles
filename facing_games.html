I really liked this puzzlescript game. A good stumper.</p>

	<h2>The good is the enemy of the done</h2> 
	<p>I kept trying to think of the best way to say things. Gave up.</p>

		<li>Happy Birthday! I hope it's lived on in memory.</li>
		<li style="width: 40%;">When I recorded this episode I was in a space of self delusion, I think. I make some joke about psychiatrist having a field day with the zine where the bird/statue says "it's never enough". It's over a year on now, I've since sat with a counsellor and talked about persistent feelings of insufficiency. I think I wanted to be in a stronger, more accepting place than I actually was. Anyway, I'm sorry - the joke and the judgements were in poor taste. Real 'log in my own eye' moment.</li>
