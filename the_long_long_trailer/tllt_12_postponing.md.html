<h1>
12 postponing
</h1>
<p>Kia ora Koutou,</p>
<p>I suppose you’ve all heard the news now. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UniteAgainstCovid19/">As of midnight Wednesday</a>, Aotearoa is going to alert level 4 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>A lot of things have changed or are going to change for the next month or so.</p>
<p>One of them is that I’m putting the newsletter on hold.</p>
<p>Another is that the estimated finish time of the caravan has been pushed back a bit.</p>
<p>A third is that I dropped my phone and damaged the camera’s focus mechanism, so I’m having trouble taking photos of our progress.</p>
<p>I know a lot of the people subscribed to this newsletter work in <a href="www.esr.cri.nz">a particular</a> essential industry - your work has always been vital, and never more than now. keep up the mahi uaua.</p>
<p>The rest of you, hole up, deep breaths, and continue routine buying habits.</p>
<p><em>The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride. - Ecclesiastes 7:8</em></p>
Ngā mihi, Giles
