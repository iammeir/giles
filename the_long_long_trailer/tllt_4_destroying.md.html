<p>Kia ora All,</p>
<p>We have arrived in Waimate safely, and spent this week excising the interior of our caravan.</p>
<p>This was probably the most straightforward section of the project. Pull, kick, rip or whack at something until it comes loose, then throw it out. Because of this simplicity it is also the shortest, taking us only about two days. I can only hope we keep up this momentum!</p>

<p>We have now removed all cladding, all fixtures, replaced the broken glass and replaced the rotten sections of the floor.</p>

<p>Initially we intended to keep the kitchen but it soon became clear this wasn’t going to work - we needed to get at the floor under it. So the lime green countertop was evicted with all its drawers. Even then we wanted to keep it in one piece, but water damage had it virtually crumbling in our hands. Still, what we could carry out was a testament to the standard of lightness we should aspire to in our rebuild. it practically floated out!</p>

<p>I’m looking at my hands now. These hands have been doing a fine office job for the last two years. They were mellow and pink at the start of the week, and now sport three scratches, three punctures, and some mysterious bruising. As much as the caravan they too are facing destruction. But this is not a sickness unto death! This is a season of growth for my body and my mind, and though in the short they will suffer, like the caravan they will emerge restored, and more - they will be stronger.</p>
<p>Next week’s newsletter will be titled <strong>Repairing</strong>.</p>
<p>The Grace of God be with you all,</p>
Ngā mihi, Giles.
