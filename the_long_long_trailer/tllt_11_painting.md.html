<p>Kia ora koutou,</p>
<p>Within the field of interior design there is a diversity of personalities. The names of different colours, for example, include Oriental Lily, Hazelnut milk, Pearly Gates, Sunnydale, Pearl Shell+ and Vanilla Cream+. These all vary in how well they describe the colour but none lack imagination. Likewise formica choices include Winter Sky, White Kashmir, Pietro Nero and Amaretto Stone.</p>

<p>At the flooring store we asked to get a sample of a certain vinyl pattern we liked.</p>
<p>“Ah,” said the assistant “Grey 596.”</p>

<p>It took one face of the wall for me to grasp what you’re trying to achieve when you lay a primer undercoat. As I’ve mentioned in earlier newsletters, some things seem perfectly obvious after the fact. Like that paint should be of uniform thickness across the wall. So after a rough start I evened up a lot and overall I was pretty proud of how most of the walls ended up.</p>

<p>I thought choosing a colour for the walls would be extremely difficult. It wasn’t. I guess it didn’t have to fit in with anything else. I’m sure further colour decisions though will get harder though. Each further colour has to fit in with the walls and every prior colour decision. The trick will be to minimise the amount of these decisions we have to make.</p>
<p>We intend to start sleeping in the caravan soon, but in the interim we have moved into a cooking magazine.</p>

<p>The Grace of God be with you all,</p>
