<h1>
16 finishing
</h1>
<p>Kia ora koutou,</p>
<p>When engaged to Erin, a few years ago, I sat down with her family to watch one of their favourite films: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047191/">The Long Long Trailer (1954)</a>.</p>
<p>My Dad made the point “So a family who grew up in a house/truck/thing are showing you a film about living in a house/truck/thing. Do you think that this might be foreshadowing something?”<br />
What, no, why would it.</p>
<p>Well, here we are now, a family living in a house/truck/thing.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure I’d finish this newsletter. Our world - the world - has changed dramatically in the 9 months since we moved south. But, again, here we are now.</p>
<p>There’s still a few things to do on the caravan. I don’t think it will ever quite be “finished” but the ongoing work will seamlessly blend into maintenance, the business of looking after our big long home.</p>
<p>We have a new project now, however. One that will take significantly more resources; significantly more time; and that I won’t (at this stage) be writing a newsletter about.</p>

<p>Thank you for following us on this journey. From myself, Erin, and Alistair, God bless you, and we wish you all the best with yours.</p>
<p>p.s. I will not be keeping any of the email addresses gathered for this newsletter. If you have enjoyed reading this, and want to be notified about any new writing projects I do, reply to this email and tell me, or keep an eye out on <a href="https://gilesgraham.xyz">gilesgraham.xyz</a></p>
