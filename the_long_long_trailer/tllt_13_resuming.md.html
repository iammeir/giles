<p>Kia ora,</p>
<p>A lot has happened since I put the newsletter on hold. Of most relevance for the newsletter is that we have now all but finished the caravan (!)</p>
<p>I’ve been less directly involved in the last stages. I can’t return to the old format of the newsletter, but I want to share with you photos of the finished caravan and describe what we’ve ended up with.</p>

<p>There will be three more editions of this newsletter, each roughly a week apart. I’ll include photos of the rooms, describe some of the decisions we’ve made, and give an update on how it’s coping with the winter weather.</p>

<p>The title of next week’s newsletter is <strong>Furnishing</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve missed you all a lot.</p>
Ngā mihi maioha, Giles.
