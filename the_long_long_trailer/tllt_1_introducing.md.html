<p>A number of people expressed interest in being kept up to date with our progress. Furthermore there are people I want to keep updated with our progress renovating a caravan. There may be some people I have not yet talked to who want to be kept updated. Finally, there’s one guy who said he’d be the first to follow the newsletter of any of his subscribers. So he doesn’t have a choice, but for the rest of you:</p>
<p>Erin and I have purchased a caravan. It’s nine metres long, two and half metres wide, it needs a lot of work, and we’re going to renovate and live in it next year. While we renovate it I’m going to keep a weekly(ish) newsletter, because I will start a writing project at the slightest provocation. If this doesn’t interest you, I completely understand, the unsubscribe button is below or just let me know some other way. If you do want to receive this newsletter, don’t do anything, it’s already heading your way.</p>
<p>I’ll cease the newsletter when we finish the caravan, circa March 2020.</p>
<p>The title of next week’s newsletter will be <strong>Shrinking</strong>.</p>
<p>The grace of God be with you all,<br />
Giles.</p>
