<h1>
15 acknowledging
</h1>
<p>Kia ora koutou,</p>
<p>I realised I’ve stopped taking photos of the caravan. Maybe it’s because it’s been naturalised to me as my house. It’s lost it’s newness, it’s specialness and distinction. it’s just our house now. our kitchen, living room, bedroom.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ve found something else to take photos of.</p>

<p>I’ve rarely mentioned the other people involved with the renovation. This hasn’t been out of a lack of gratitude, but only a respect for privacy. The newsletter isn’t a place for me to share the lives of others. But I can only do that for so long before I must recognise on here that nothing could have been done on this caravan without a lot of work by many people. Here I want to briefly acknowledge some of them.</p>

<p>The two immediate people to mention are my wife Erin, and my Father in law Alan. Alan is indefatigable. He really has led the renovations, knowing the order that things have to happen, telling us what supplies to get. There isn’t a piece of the caravan that he has not personally worked on. He built the drawers in our bedroom. He worked on our caravan to the exclusion of other, paying work. This was a huge sacrifice for him and my Mother in law. Thank you Alan.</p>
<p>Next to him is Erin, who worked ceaselessly as well, especially when I went back to work she carried on, and the caravan wouldn’t be where it is today without her pushing it to this point. Thank you Erin.</p>

<p>Also responsible for getting the caravan to where it is today is my father, Bill, who came and stayed for a time before lockdown and really helped speed along the caravan at a crucial point in the renovation. Additionally he brought a motorised winch, which literally got the caravan moving at a faster pace. Thank you Dad, and Mum for letting him come and help.</p>
<p>For lending the use of a vehicle to get the caravan to our current residence, thanks to Peter and the company he works for.</p>

<p>For hiring me again during the lockdown, thanks ESR.</p>

<p>For fabric donated, time given, items gifted, encouragement, support, advice, assistance and countless other contributions to the renovation of our new home, thank you to all who played a part. Our home is not just made of plywood and aluminuim, but is clad in the love and support of all of you.</p>

<p>Thanks be to God, who has guided us every step of the way. It was by His calling that we moved, and it has been His peace that has abided through this exceptional year.</p>

<p>Finally, for reading this newsletter, thank you.</p>
<p>The last newsletter will be called: <strong>Finishing</strong></p>
<p>Mā te wā,</p>
Giles.
