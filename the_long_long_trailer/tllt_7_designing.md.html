<p><strong>It is a truth universally acknowledged that the bathroom should go here.</strong></p>
<p><em>If it does, where do we fit the bed?</em></p>
<p><strong>Well, it can sort of go under the window, here … oh that’s not a lot of space</strong></p>
<p><em>That would mean anyone going to the toilet would pass through our bedroom</em></p>
<p><strong>Alright, where do you think it should go?</strong></p>
<p><em>Here, opposite the kitchen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Abominable.</strong></p>

<p>We did find the right place for the bathroom, and the kitchen. Not every detail is sorted but we have enough now to throw in some plumbing and wiring.</p>
<p>This week was short for us and so is this newsletter as we we went away Friday to Monday to do some research.</p>
