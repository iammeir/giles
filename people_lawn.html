  <p><strong>To the Statues' Owner</strong><p>
  <p>
    You have <br>
    such beautiful people <br>
    lying <br>
    in your front yard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aquiline, refined,<br>
    regal. Oh to own
  </p>
  <p>
    a front yard of my own,<br>
    and staff it with such perfect,<br>
    peaceful figures.
  </p>
